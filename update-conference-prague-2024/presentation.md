# What is "Entire Stack" programming?

- I made it up
- Doing all development in the same set of tools
- Frontend - Backend - CI/CD - IaC - Unit/Integration/Performance Testing

---

# Where did it come from?

- I'm a developer
  - We Automate Things
- I had to make CI/CD pipelines
- I had to automate infrastructure

---

# Why C# for the Entire Stack?

- ".NET Everywhere"
  - Scott Hanselman talked about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM6OO2lkxA4
